# MaGDAA - Data Reception Management #

The [Mass Gathering Data Acquisition and Analysis][magdaa] project, MaGDAA for short, is a collaboration between the [Flinders University Disaster Research Centre][fudrc] and [The Serval Project][sp] at [Flinders University][fusa] in South Australia.

The focus of the project is on the development of an [Android][android] based platform that can be used to acquire and analyse data at a mass gathering event. For example at a music festival, Schoolies Week, or any other event where a crowd has gathered.

The purpose of the Data Reception Management (DaRMa) application is to:

1. Receive data from the [Rhizome][rhizome] component of a [Serval Mesh][serval] network
2. Copy the data into the required location for the various MaGDAA related software
3. Notify the appropriate MaGDAA software to continue processing the new data file

More information about the software is available in the [MaGDAA wiki][wiki]
